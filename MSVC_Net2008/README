Building cairomm-1.0 with Visual Studio .NET 2005

* You will need Visual Studio .NET 2005 (MSVC 8.0).  Earlier versions of the compiler, including 6.0 and 7.0 might also work but have not been tested.
* Install the latest Win32 GTK+ Development Environment from the Glade for Windows project, http://gladewin32.sourceforge.net.
* Add libsigc++ to the include and lib paths in Visual Studio.
* Load the cairomm/MSVC3/cairomm.sln solution.
* Build the entire solution.
* Run the tests.
