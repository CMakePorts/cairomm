1.4.6:

 * Bugfixes:
   - Bug #11972: Cannot build cairomm with Quartz enabled

1.4.4:

 * Added the --enable-api-exceptions=yes/no configure option, to allow 
   cairomm to build when exceptions are disabled. For instance, when using
   CXXFLAGS=-fno-exceptions with g++.

1.4.2:

 * Bugfixes:
   - Bug #11596: Fixed broken shared library versioning (Dave Beckett)
   - Bug #8511: RefPtr: refcounting broken with cast_*() methods (Murray
     Cumming)

1.4.0:

 * Wrapped new API added in cairo 1.4
 * Added support for Quartz surfaces
 * ability to use dynamic casting for surfaces and patterns returned from
   Context::get_target(), Context::get_source(), etc.
 * Various build and bug fixes

1.2.4:

 * Fixed an error that prevented Cairo::RefPtr<>::cast_static() and
   Cairo::RefPtr<>::cast_dynamic() from compiling.

1.2.2:

* Fixed an issue when compiling on windows with MSVC

1.2.0:

* This is the first release that guarantees API and ABI stability
* Changed API:
  - Context::clear_path() is now Context::begin_new_path()
  - Context::new_sub_path() is now Context::begin_new_sub_path()
* new API:
  - Win32Surface::get_dc()
  - Win32Surface::create() for device-independent bitmaps
* Bugfixes
  - fixed a memory leak where C++ wrapper objects were not being destroyed
* Fixes for compiling with MSVC (also includes project and resource files for
  Visual Studio 2005.  See the MSVC/ directory)

1.1.10:

* API:
  - Wrap new API from cairo 1.2
  - Wrap ScaledFont
* Improved Documentation
* Build fixes

0.6.0:

* API:
  - enumerations are now wrapped within the Cairo namespace.  So, for example,
    CAIRO_FORMAT_ARGB32 becomes Cairo::FORMAT_ARGB32
* Examples: added simple text example translated from Cairo.
* Bugfixes for the Glitz and Windows backends. 
* Build and installation improvements (Danilo Piazzalunga)

0.5.0:

* Surface:
  - Created derived classes for PDF, PS, SVG, Glitz, 
  X11 and Win32 surfaces, which are only available if your copy 
  of cairo supports those surfaces. The X11 and Win32 Surface headers 
  must be #included explicitly.
  (Jonathon Jongsma)
  - Added write_to_png() and write_to_png_stream(), available when PNG 
  support is available in Cairo.
  (Jonathon Jongsma)
* Examples: Added PNG, PDF, PS, and SVG Surface examples.
  (Jonathon Jongsma)
* Added API documentation generation with doxygen (Jonathon Jongsma)
 
0.4.0:

* Add Cairo::RefPtr<> and use all reference-counted 
  objects via it. Use the static create() methods 
  instead of new for these classes.
* Context:
  - Change set_dash(void) to unset_dash().
  - Change rotate_deg() to rotate_degrees().
  - Change identity_matrix() to set_identity_matrix().\
  - Change new_path() to clear_path().
* FontFace: Remove get/set_user_data(), because it seems useless.

0.3.0:

* Context:
  - Change mask_surface() to mask() and
    set_source_surface() to set_source().
  - Add typedef for Matrix, but a real Matrix 
  class would be nice.
* Pattern: Created hierarchy of classes.
* Check for errors in constructors.
* Exception: Rename to logic_error, and throw 
  std::bad_alloc or std::io_base::failure instead 
  when appropriate.
