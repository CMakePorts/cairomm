cairomm
-------------

This library provides a C++ interface to cairo.

Read the file 'INSTALL' for instructions to compile and install the library.

See the examples directory for example code.

Use pkg-config to discover the necessary include and linker arguments. For instance,
  pkg-config cairomm-1.0 --cflags --libs
Ideally you would use PKG_CHECK_MODULES in your configure.ac file.
See http://www.openismus.com for generic help with that.
