Examples:

Simple parsing examples:
  dom_parser - Shows how to parse an XML Document with the DOM parser.
  sax_parser - Shows how to parse an XML Document with the SAX parser.

Building XML doxuments:
  dom_build - Shows how to build an XML document using the DOM Parser API.
  sax_parser_build_dom - Shows how to parse an XML document with the SAX parser, building a separate custom DOM as you parse.
  dom_read_write: Reads an XML document with the DOM parser and writes it again. The output should be the same as the input.
  import_node: Adds a part of an XML document to another, using the DOM parser.
  
Entity parsing:

  sax_parser_entities: Shows how to detect (and maybe resolve) entity references when using the SAX Parser.
